/// A store represents the runtime that powers the application. It is the object that you will pass
/// around to views that need to interact with the application.
///
/// You will typically construct a single one of these at the root of your application:
///
/// ```swift
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///
///   @ViewStore var store = AppFeature.State()
///
///   var body: some Scene {
///     WindowGroup {
///       RootView($store)
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// â€¦and then use the ``scope(_ keyPath:)`` method to derive more focused stores that can be
/// passed to subviews.
///
/// ### Scoping
///
/// The most important operation defined on ``Store`` is the ``scope(get:set:)`` or ``scope(_ keyPath:)`` methods,
/// which allows you to transform a store into one that deals with child state. This is
/// necessary for passing stores to subviews that only care about a small portion of the entire
/// application's domain.
/// The store supports dynamic member lookup so that you can scope with a specific field in the state.
///
/// For example, if an application has a tab view at its root with tabs for activity, search, and
/// profile, then we can model the domain like this:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppFeature {
///   var activity: Activity.State
///   var profile: Profile.State
///   var search: Search.State
/// }
/// ```
///
/// We can construct a view for each of these domains by applying ``scope(_ keyPath:)`` to
/// a store that holds onto the full app domain in order to transform it into a store for each
/// subdomain:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct AppView: View {
///
///   @ViewStore state: AppFeature
///
///   init(_ store: Store<AppFeature>) {
///    	_state = ViewStore(store)
///   }
///
///   init() {
///     _state = ViewStore(AppFeature())
///   }
///
///   var body: some View {
///     TabView {
///       ActivityView(
///         $state.activity // same as $state.scope(\.activity)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Activity") }
///
///       SearchView(
///         $state.search // same as $state.scope(\.search)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Search") }
///
///       ProfileView(
///         $state.profile // same as $state.scope(\.profile)
///       )
///       .tabItem { Text("Profile") }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
